Create a conda environment:

to create: conda create -n lacture_1 python=3.7
to activate: conda activate lacture_1
to remove: conda env remove -n lacture_1 (don't remove)


Install project related packages:
conda install --file Projects/Wine\ Reviews\ -\ Completed/requirements.txt
pip install -r Projects/Wine\ Reviews\ -\ Completed/requirements.txt


Add Virtual Environment to Jupyter Lab as a kernel:

Jupyter lab makes sure that the IPython kernel is available, but you have to manually add a kernel with a different version of Python or a virtual environment. First, you need to activate your virtual environment. Next, install ipykernel which provides the IPython kernel for Jupyter:

pip install --user ipykernel
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=lacture_1

Now run:
conda deactivate
(Now that we have a matching kernel per our env, we don't need it activated)
