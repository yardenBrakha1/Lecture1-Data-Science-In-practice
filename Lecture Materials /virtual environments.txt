Add Virtual Environment to Jupyter Lab as a kernel:

Jupyter lab makes sure that the IPython kernel is available, but you have to manually add a kernel with a different version of Python or a virtual environment. First, you need to activate your virtual environment. Next, install ipykernel which provides the IPython kernel for Jupyter:

pip install --user ipykernel
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=lacture_1
